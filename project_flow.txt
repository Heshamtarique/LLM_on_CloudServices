various AWS services: 
looking into the AWS bedrock as they provide various Foundation models without worrying about Inference issues... Huggingface in Sagemaker & finally deploy it

GenAI project lifecycle:
    4 to 5 steps:
        (a): defyning the usecases

        (b): right model for right usecase/data --> FoundationModels[direct usage or Finetuning] or Custom LLMs 

        (c): USe prompt Engineering & solve the business case or Finetuning from data we have or Training with Human Feedback

        (d): Evaluating LLMs with the right metric

        (e): Deployment... Application Integration [1: optimize, deploy models for Inferencing & build the app] --  LLMOps[AWS, GCP, Azure]


Blog Generation:
    API {amazon API gateway}: request object: remember postman API we hit: 
    once we trigger an API in amazon API gateway Lambda function will come into picture which will interact with Amazon bedrock
    which host lots of LLMs. Lambda function will be responsible for taking the query to the hosted models and get the output back. 
    The ouput we will be storing on S3.

    overview of bedrock @FoundationModels: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=ap-south-1#/overview
    say we are making EC2 instance- setup all the things, install or requiemrts,libraries, develop entire Application
    and then with API gateway try to invoke AWS bedrock... another approach is to use AWS Lambda (lets you run the code without thinking about the servers)
    https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ap-south-1#/begin
    
    craeting the lambda function
    once we created the lambda function.... we will be coding there, but UI is not so interactive. code here and just pasting there

    Layer creation: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ap-south-1#/create/layer

    URL to be invoked: https://yi3f3w5a6k.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev

    now creating S3 bucket:
        create an s3 where we will store data, files etc
    hitting the post request with request object as: https://yi3f3w5a6k.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/blog-generation
    endpoint is blog-generation
    Logs can be seen in: aws_cloud_watch
